# BPIC17 Project

To run this project you need to install all the requiremtns 
that are included in the requirements.txt file.

You can use: pip install -r requirements.txt

You need to download the .xes log file by yourself (install rustxes for faster reading)
as it is too big for Github and adapt all paths that are marked
with a #Todo
